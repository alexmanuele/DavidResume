give back to community to help support services and events that continuously bring people
together. For example, from 2014 - 2015, I volunteered as Head Coach for Martyr&#39;s basketball, a
boy&#39;s basketball team comprising youth ages 14-15. During my time at Martyr&#39;s, I strove to teach
the boys the value of hard work and determination. Continuing with my passion for the
development of basketball in Canada, I also volunteered for the USports Final 8 Basketball
tournament when it was held in Halifax in 2017 and again in 2018.</p>

                I am constantly looking for ways to create synergistic partnerships. While working for the Blue
Nose Marathon, I facilitated a partnership with Moksha Yoga Halifax, the studio in which I
volunteer with. I am a vey active member at Moksha Yoga Halifax and believed they aligned
strongly with the goal of the Blue Nose; to engage the imaginations of fellow Nova Scotians in a
way that inspires them to seek healthy, active and vital lifestyles. I proposed to Moksha a
potential partnership opportunity, it was no surprise to see Moksha become an enthusiastic
partner of the Blue Nose Marathon. This also helped the growth and development of the run club
at Moksha to prepare for the Blue Nose. This partnership helped inspire runners to try yoga
while inspiring yogis to try running!</p>

               Promoting a healthy and active lifestyle for everyone includes children. That is why the Blue Nose Marathon places such an emphasis on the Youth Run. I was given the task of designing and implementing an promotional outreach program to increase youth registration and spread the word about the Blue Nose. I visited children around the HRM, with our amazing mascot Myles, to teach them about the importance of having a strong heart to prepare for a big race like the Blue Nose. We played games with Myles and I discussed the connection between physical activity and our heart rates, and how it connects to health.</p>
